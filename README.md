# Speech-to-Text Translation using Transformer

This project implements a robust speech-to-text translation system that utilizes the Transformer architecture for converting English speech into Hindi and German. The model is trained using the LJ Speech dataset, which provides high-quality English speech recordings paired with corresponding text.

Features of the project includes:
1. Speech Recognition - Converts spoken English language into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) techniques.
2. Machine Translation - Translates the recognized English text into Hindi and German, showcasing multilingual capabilities.
3. Transformer Model - Utilizes the Transformer architecture to enhance translation accuracy and efficiency.
4. Dataset - Employs the LJ Speech dataset, known for its extensive collection of English speech data, enabling effective training and evaluation.
5. Evaluation - Evaluate the performance of both the ASR and translation components using relevant metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) for ASR and BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR scores for translation accuracy.
